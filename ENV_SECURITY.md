# Environment Variable Security Guidelines

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env files to version control**
   - Always add .env files to .gitignore
   - Use .env.example files for documentation

2. **Use different variables for each environment**
   - Development
   - Testing
   - Staging
   - Production

3. **Rotate secrets regularly**
   - Change passwords and keys quarterly
   - Use the generate-secrets.sh script

4. **Limit access to production secrets**
   - Only DevOps and senior developers should have access
   - Use a secure vault solution for production

5. **Validate environment variables on startup**
   - Fail fast if required variables are missing
   - See the validation code in each project

6. **Use encryption for sensitive values**
   - Encrypt sensitive values stored in the database
   - Use ENCRYPTION_KEY for this purpose

7. **Follow principle of least privilege**
   - Services should only have access to the variables they need

8. **Document all environment variables**
   - Keep .env.example up to date
   - Document purpose and format of each variable

## Environment Setup Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy .env.example to .env
3. Run ./generate-secrets.sh to create secure values
4. Add the generated values to your .env file
5. Never share your .env file

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployment, use a secure vault solution like:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- HashiCorp Vault
- Kubernetes Secrets

The deployment pipeline should retrieve secrets from the vault service
and inject them into the application environment.
